### Welcome  üôåüèæ

I'm Henrich Tanis, an enthusiastic software engineer who is passionate about creating impactful solutions to real-world problems. As an entry-level developer, I am constantly striving to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field, and GitHub is the perfect platform for me to document my journey.

During my time in school, I acquired a solid foundation in programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, . Since then, I have been working on various coding projects to put my skills into practice and hone my craft. I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with other developers to build innovative applications.

My areas of interest include[web development,database systems, mobile app development,UI/UX design] and I enjoy exploring how technology can improve our daily lives. Other than coding, I love to [workout, watch sports , play basketball, eat,] which keeps me motivated and energized.
